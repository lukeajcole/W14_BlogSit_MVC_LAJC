Before this site can be used, be sure to fill out the .env.EXAMPLE file with your database information. Next, you will also need to make a clean database called "blog_db"

with the database created, run the following code in the command line from the ame directory as "server" in order to seed the database
 ```md
node seeds/index.js
 ```

Be sure to run the following command in a terminal that's opened in the same directory as server.js:
 ```md
 npm install
 ```
Finally, you can run the following code to run the backend and see it in action in an app like insomnia
